# Architecture Decision Records

Use this folder to capture significant architectural or tooling decisions.

## ADR Format
1. Sequential ID (e.g., `0001-use-react-query`).
2. Title summarizing the decision.
3. Sections: Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences.
4. Reference related tasks or specs.

## Workflow
- Draft ADR as part of discovery or before implementing major changes.
- Keep ADRs immutable; create a superseding record if the decision changes.
- Link ADRs from `/docs/tasks.md` or relevant issues for traceability.
